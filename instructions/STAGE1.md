# Stage 1: The Base Project

In this stage, there are a few files that have been written to allow you to create the game Pong in Processing. In this stage, we will:

- Look at how top-down design allows us to tackle the task at a high level and then break it down into smaller chunks
- Look at how bottom-up design creates libraries that can be used as a foundation for other software
- Determine the relationships between the various objects in the Pong game, and how that works in Object Oriented Programming

The end product of this stage will be:

- A UML diagram that shows the classes we will need to write for this project
