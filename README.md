# Processing Pong

### Introduction

This is a framework for an implementation of Pong using the [Processing](http://processing.org) visual arts sketchbook language. It is meant as a demonstration of how Object Oriented programming works, and each branch of this repository is a snapshot of a stage of the design process.

### Instructions

- Download and install [Processing](http://processing.org) for your operating system.
- If you wish to follow along, select the [`stage-1-base-project`](https://github.com/jchuahtacc/ProcessingPong/tree/stage-1-base-project) branch, download and uncompress it (or check it out using Git) and load the `pong.pde` file in the `Pong` folder.
- By following the instructions located in the [`instructions`] folder for each stage, you will be able to follow along and progress the project to the next stage.

If you want to see what was done in a previous stage, view the commit history for the current stage. For example, commits made to Stage 2 are the modifications necessary to take the project from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
